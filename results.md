In 2023, New York City experienced some significant air quality issues. In the first week of June, the city saw some of the worst air pollution on record as levels of harmful PM 2.5 particles skyrocketed due to smoke from wildfires in Quebec, Canada[^1]. On Wednesday, June 7, measurements of daily-average PM 2.5 in New York City reached a record-breaking 117 µg/m³[^1]. This value exceeds the previous New York City record (86 µg/m³), is three times higher than the guideline value set by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (35 µg/m³), and is over eight times higher than the guideline value set by the World Health Organisation (WHO) (15 µg/m³)[^1].

However, within days, the air quality had returned to “good”, according to IQAir[^1]. As of August 29, the air quality index was good with a US AQI of 36 and a PM2.5 concentration of 8.7 µg/m³[^2].
